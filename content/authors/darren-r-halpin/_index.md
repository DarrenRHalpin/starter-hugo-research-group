bio: "I am a Professor of Political Science at the Australian National
  University. I research and write about organised interests in politics
  (interest groups, thinks tanks, corporations and lobbyists) and political
  representation, and the connections between the two.  My first book Groups,
  Democracy and Representation: Between Promise and Practice (2010, Manchester
  University Press), probed what we should expect groups to contribute to
  democratic representation. My follow up book The Organization of Political
  Interest Groups: Designing Advocacy (2014, Routledge), pioneers an
  organisational social science perspective on interest groups, spanning group
  formation through to the exercise of policy influence.  In early 2021, my new
  book, with Anthony J. Nownes, The New Entrepreneurial Advocacy: Silicon Valley
  Elites in American Politics, is out with Oxford University Press. It provides
  a deep dive into the political engagement of this important slice of corporate
  America. Find details here.  You can find out more about this book, all my
  previous work, and current projects on this website.  You can find also me on
  Twitter (@darren_halpin) and on LinkedIn"
