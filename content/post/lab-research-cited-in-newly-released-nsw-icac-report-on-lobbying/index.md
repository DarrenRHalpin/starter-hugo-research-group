The NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) has just released its final report from its investigation (named Operation Eclipse) into "Lobbying and the NSW public sector - the regulation of lobbying, access and influence in NSW". It was a wide ranging investigation into the pitfalls and practices into lobbying and political influence in NSW. In a submission to the inquiry, Lab Director Professor Darren Halpin outlined recent research he has conducted - with a Lab Intern Mr. Anthony Lotric (and B. Political Science Student) - into the accuracy of the Federal Lobby Register's self reported data on revolving door lobbying. Importantly, based on an extensive manual search of lobbyists websites, LinkedIn profiles and media reports, they found that the register seriously under reported links between current commercial lobbyists covered by the Federal Register, and those who had served previously in roles as government representatives. Moreover, when one took a more sensible definition of former government representative - the Lobby Register employs a very narrow definition - the work found that more than half of all commercial lobbyists registered have some prior connection to government (state or federal).
